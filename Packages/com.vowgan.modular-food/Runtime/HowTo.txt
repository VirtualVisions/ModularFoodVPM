‚¨ó How to use:
    Made sure to be using the latest version of VRChat's SDK through their Creator Companion (VCC).
	1. Add "Food List" and "Burger Station" prefabs into your scene.
	2. If you want a custom assortment of props, manually add Plates and Food Part Spawns into your scene.
	3. For custom Food Part Spawns, select in the dropdown from the library in Food List.

--------------------
‚¨¢ Prefabs:
	‚¨° Food List: 
		A list of any and all parts that can be used to generate food pieces.
		Add more parts by adding prefabs or scene objects into the list.
		"Height" is the height of the part, so that stacking pieces correctly add on top of each other.

	‚¨° Food Part Spawn:
		The grabbable piece to add onto a plate.
		Select from a dropdown to choose which food part this spawn will be associated with.
		This dropdown shows all options within the Food List in your scene.

	‚¨° Plate:
		The object to hold the food on.
		Place a Food Part Spawn against the plate to add it's associated part onto the plate.

	‚¨° Trash:
		Respawns and clears a plate when placed inside.

	‚¨° Burger Station:
		Fully set up demo of features.
		Requires a Food List to be added to the scene as well, so you can have multiple burger stations and one Food List.

	‚¨° Burger Parts:
		Model prefabs for all the base burger parts.
		Many include an LOD system for optimizing between High and Low versions of the burger part model.
